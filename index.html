                    <p>I've used all of the personal finance apps on the market, 
                        <br>and found that most have a hard time syncing my 
                        <br>various bank accounts and cards real-time, leaving me 
                        <br>guessing sometimes for days. Blick was a pleasant 
                        <br>surprise! The team has really worked hard to ensure 
                        <br>instant syncronization with most of the mainstream 
                        <br>banks and lenders. Impressed!

                    <p>I rely on my budgeting spreadsheet since it helps me 
                        <br>organize my spending data into meaningful charts and 
                        <br>tables. That's why I've been comprehensive about 
                        <br>switching to a personal finance app, as I found that the 
                        <br>data presentation was usually lacking at best. Lo and 
                        <br>behold, Blick was the only app that made the cut!
